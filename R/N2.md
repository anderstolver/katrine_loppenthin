# Code / comments

This template generates output for numerical/continuous outcome.

The following are computed

## Summary measures

For each combination of assessment time and randomization group we compute

* number of observations (excluding missing data!)
* mean
* standard deviation
* median
* interquantile range (given by 25 % and 75 % quantiles)

For each randomization group summary measures are also computed for changes over time (baseline to follow up).

## Model based estimates

A linear mixed model with fixed effects of time, randomization group and their interaction as well as random effect of subject/ID_NUM is used to extract

* mean estimate for alle combinations of group and time
* within group changes over time
* comparison of within group changes over time across the two groups

The tables produced extract

* estimates
* standard error on estimates
* P-value (for testing if estimate equals to zero)
* lower and upper 95 % confidence interval for estimate

## Source Code


```r
sum_na <- function(x){sum(!is.na(x))}
my_funs <- funs(n = sum_na, mean = round(mean(., na.rm = T), digits = 4), sd = round(sd(., na.rm = T), digits = 4), median = median(., na.rm = T), q25 = quantile(., probs = 0.25, na.rm = T), q75 = quantile(., probs = 0.75, na.rm = T))

print_num <- function(varname, df = data_full){
    group_by(df, time, Randomisering) %>% 
    select(time, Randomisering, varname) %>%
    summarize_at(.vars = varname, .funs = my_funs) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Randomisering))
}
```
